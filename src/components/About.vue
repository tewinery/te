                Té was founded by Ross Kenyon whose roots go back to the industrial
                heartlands of Yorkshire, where tea is more than a drink, it’s a way of
                life.

              Ross shares his enthusiasm for tea with a passion for fine wine and a
              wonderment that through leaf or grape the culture, history and climate
              of a place is revealed.
            </p>
            <p class="is-size-3">
              This has led him to ask the question,
              <br class="is-hidden-mobile is-hidden-tablet-only is-hidden-desktop-only" />
              “Can I capture the essence of a place through its tea, within a
              fine&nbsp;wine?”
            </p>
            <p>
              And many months, many trials and several years later the answer
              to that question is, “Yes!” And with it Té Wine was born.
