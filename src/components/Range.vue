          Té is a range of six wines made from six unique teas grown in six
          unique places.
        </p>
        <p class="is-size-3">
          Our first wine is 'Darjeeling' and it will be joined by others along
          with special editions.
        </p>


        <p>
          Darjeeling is known as the ‘Champagne’ of teas and has a unique aroma
          likened to that of the Muscatel grape.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is harvested in and around its namesake town of Darjeeling which
          is located in the Indian State of West Bengal, at an elevation of
          6,700 feet.
        </p>

        <p>
          We specifically source our Darjeeling from the Mim Estate located in
          Sukhiapokhri, nestled in the foothills of the Himalayas. It is a
          government owned tea garden, which produces a finest, tippy, golden,
          flowery, orange, pekoe leaf or in-short an FTGFOP-1
        </p>

        <p>
          This single origin tea yields a light orange coloured liquor with a
          delicate floral aroma with just a hint of spiciness.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a wine our Darjeeling pairs well with coriander, cardamom and fish
          based dishes, or serve chilled as an aperitif.
